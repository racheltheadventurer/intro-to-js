# intro-to-js

Hiya! Welcome to my first repository. 

I've started a journey at General Assembly this week and I will be documenting literally everything I hand-code through the course. It's like a whole new world now that I am actually coding and I often feel 
retarded but i'll be keeping my head up. 

Divide and conquer.
