# intro-to-js

Hiya! 

Welcome to my first repository. 

After being in IT consulting for nearly about 3 years, I've decided to sign myself up
for the full-time (well, flex hours but full-time almost) software engineer course at one of the finest coding schools on 
Earth called General Assembly. 

I will be documenting literally everything I handcode through the course. Baby steps... x
