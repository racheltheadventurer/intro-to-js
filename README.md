# intro-to-js

Hiya! Welcome to my first repository. 

I've started a journey at General Assembly this week and I will be documenting literally everything I hand-code throughout the course. The course is way more challenging than I expected and I already feel like I am losing my mind. Just gotta keep my
head up - divide and conquer!
