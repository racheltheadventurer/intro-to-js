// ## exercise #1 : be your own fortune teller 
//- Store the following into variables: number of children, partner’s name, geographic location, job title
//- Use adequate types for each variable
//- Output your fortune to the screen like so “You will be a X in Y, and amrried to Z with N kids.”
//

let numberOfchildren = ‘4’
let partnersName = ‘Abel’
let city = ‘Seoul’
let jobTitle = ‘Developer’

console.log(“You will be a ” + jobTitle + ” in ” + city + “, and married to ” + partnersName + ” with ” + numberOfchildren + ” kids.“)


//### exercise #2 : the age calculator 

//forgot how old someone is? calculate it!

//- Store the current year in a variable
//- Store their birth year in a variable
//- Calculate their 2 possible ages based on the stored values
//- Output them to the screen like so : “They are either NM or NN’. substituting the values”

const currentYear = 2019;
const birthYear = 1990;

const age = (currentYear-birthYear);
console.log( `they are either ${age} or ${age-1}`);


//## exercise #3 : how long would it last? 

// let's say you eat your favorite snack everyday - how many do you need to last? 

const currentAge = 26;
const maxAge = 90;
const snackPerDay = 2;
const daysInYear = 365;

const total = (maxAge-currentAge)*snackPerDay*daysInYear
// do not use *magic numbers* - always over-communicate

const lifeTimeSupply = (maxAge-currentAge)*snackPerDay*daysInYear

console.log(lifeTimeSupply);

console.log(`You will need ${lifeTimeSupply} to last you until the ripe age of ${maxAge}`);
